What exactly are logic gates?

You've probably heard of logic gates before. Logic gates are the basic components of how any computer work, and you link them together to make fancier logic circuits. Think of it like legos, each piece is small and simple on its own but when put together they can create huge sets.

How do they work?

Logic gates are simple. They take in inputs, and based on those inputs they give an output. Switches, on and off, 1s and 0s. They're like an if statement in programming.

Examples?

Sure. Let's start with the basic 3 gates. AND, OR, and NOT. An AND gate will only give an output signal if both input signals are there. So an input of 1 and 1 will give an output of 1, but 0/0, 1/0, and 0/1 will give an output of 0, since one or both inputs is not on. An OR gate, on the other hand, only requires one of the inputs. 1/1, 0/1, and 1/0 all work and give an output of 1, but 0/0 still gives an output of 0. A NOT gate, also called an inverter, gives the opposite state of its singular input. 1 gives 0, 0 gives 1.

How are these useful?

Well, you can build them together! The output of one gate can be the input of another gate. We can make fancier logic gates, like NAND and NOR, out of the basic 3. An AND gate leading into a NOT gate makes a NAND gate, where the output is 1 unless both inputs are 1, and similarly an OR gate leading into a NOT gate gives a NOR gate, where both inputs must be off to get an output. You can combine these new gates in even more complex circuitry to create all sorts of systems, but if I were to describe them all I'm pretty sure I'd run out of file space.

Feel free to experiment with this program to learn more about logic gates, and if this explanation and the program don't clear anything up. leave a comment!
